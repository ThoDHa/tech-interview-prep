Reference implementation of the write-up's Kahn's Algorithm solution, kept
next to the harness so authored cases stay falsifiable. Your own attempt
lives in solution.py.

        Builds the prerequisite graph (edge `b -> a` for each `[a, b]`
        pair), counts each course's unmet prerequisites, and repeatedly
        takes courses whose count reaches 0; producing fewer than
        `numCourses` courses means a cycle blocked the rest.

        Args:
            numCourses: Number of courses, labeled `0..numCourses - 1`.
            prerequisites: Pairs `[a, b]` meaning course `b` before `a`.

        Returns:
            A topological order of all courses, or an empty list when the
            graph is cyclic.

        Time:  O(V + E): every course and prerequisite pair is processed
