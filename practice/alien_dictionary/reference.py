"""Alien Dictionary — https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/alien_dictionary.md
Reference implementation of the write-up's Kahn's Algorithm (Topological Sort
via BFS) solution.

There is a new alien language that uses the English alphabet, but the order of the letters is unknown. You are given a list of strings `words` from the alien language's dictionary. It is claimed that the strings in `words` are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. If this claim is incorrect, and the given arrangement of strings in `words` cannot correspond to any order of letters, return `""`. Otherwise, return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in lexicographically increasing order by the new language's rules. If there are multiple solutions, return **any** of them.

        Extracts one precedence edge per differing letter pair from each
        adjacent word pair, then runs Kahn's algorithm: repeatedly take a
        zero-indegree letter. A prefix violation (`abc` before `ab`) or an
        extracted cycle leaves letters untaken and returns "".

        Args:
            args: One element, `words`: list of lowercase strings claimed to
                be sorted by the alien order.

        Returns:
            One valid ordering of the unique letters as a string, or "" when
            the claim is impossible.

        Time:  O(total): every character is inspected a constant number of
            times, where total is the sum of word lengths.
        Space: O(1): the adjacency map and indegrees hold at most 26 letters.
