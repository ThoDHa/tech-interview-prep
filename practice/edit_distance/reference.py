"""Edit Distance — https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/

Write-up & approaches: ../../docs/problems/edit_distance.md
Reference implementation of the write-up's Space-Optimized Two-Row DP solution.

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each consisting of lowercase English letters. You may insert, delete, or replace characters any number of times; return the minimum number of operations to make `word1` equal `word2`.

  uv run python edit_distance/reference.py   # debug one case (see CASE below)
  uv run pytest edit_distance/              # run the test sets

        Walks the classic prefix table: `previous[j]` is the edit distance
        between the first `i - 1` characters of `word1` and the first `j`
        of `word2`; `current[j]` is built for the first `i`. Matching ends are
        free; otherwise the cell takes one plus the best of deleting,
        inserting, or replacing. Only two rows are alive at any time.

        Args:
            word1: Source string, 0 <= len(word1) <= 100, lowercase letters.
            word2: Target string, 0 <= len(word2) <= 100, lowercase letters.

        Returns:
            The fewest operations turning `word1` into `word2`.

        Time:  O(m * n): one comparison per table cell (m = len(word1),
            n = len(word2)).
        Space: O(n): the two live rows.
